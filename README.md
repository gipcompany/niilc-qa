# NIILC Question Answering Dataset

This project provides a dataset for supporting the development of
question answering systems.  The data includes questions and their
answers, and meta information such as question types, clues to obtain
answers, Wikipedia pages in which answers can be found, and SPARQL
queries for JWO (Japanese Wikipedia Ontology).

Currently, only Japanese data is provided.

See [our homepage](http://mynlp.github.io/niilc-qa/) for details.
